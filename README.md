An app that I would like to build would be an app relating to health. I would want it to be multi-purpose app. For example, the app would allow users to track calories consumed and track fitness ( steps taken per day). So it would be like a health sort of app that's on our iPhones. The features would allow users to track what they put inside their bodies and stay within their goal of how many calories to consume. It would also feature a way for them to track their health but running/walking.
